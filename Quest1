Explain what the simple List component does.

The List component is a commonly used user interface (UI) element that allows for the display of a collection of items in an ordered or unordered list format.
A simple List component typically contains a list of text items, such as a menu, a directory of items, or a set of options for users to choose from. It can also display more complex data structures like objects, images, or links.
The list can be organized in different ways, such as in a vertical or horizontal layout, with or without bullets or numbering, and with or without indentation. It is also possible to add interactivity to the List component, such as allowing users to select items and triggering an action based on the selection.
Overall, the List component is a versatile and essential UI element used in many web and mobile applications to present information in a structured and easily digestible format.

example of the List component in action
<ul>
  <li>Apple announces new MacBook Pro</li>
  <li>Google introduces new search algorithm</li>
  <li>Microsoft acquires GitHub</li>
  <li>Facebook launches new social media platform</li>
</ul>
This code defines an unordered List (<ul>) containing four list items (<li>) that represent the titles of the articles. When this code is rendered in a web browser, it will display the list like this:
Apple announces new MacBook Pro
Google introduces new search algorithm
Microsoft acquires GitHub
Facebook launches new social media platform
